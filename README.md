Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in restaurant reviews. The goal is to classify reviews into positive or negative categories, providing valuable insights into customer opinions and satisfaction. We employ the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm, due to its effectiveness in text classification tasks and its efficiency with large datasets.

Dataset
The dataset comprises user-generated restaurant reviews. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative, reflecting the customer's overall experience. This dataset is crucial in training and evaluating our model's performance.

Methodology
Preprocessing
The reviews undergo several preprocessing steps to convert raw text into a format suitable for model training:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Converting all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Removing stop words and punctuation: Excluding common words and punctuation that do not contribute to sentiment analysis.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
Feature Extraction
We use the Bag of Words model to convert text documents into numerical vectors, a format the algorithm can interpret. The importance of each word in representing the content of the documents is quantified through this approach.

Model
Naive Bayes Classifier is chosen for its simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency in handling large datasets. It's based on applying Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between every pair of features.

Implementation
The implementation is done using Python, leveraging libraries such as numpy, pandas for data handling, nltk for natural language processing tasks, and sklearn for model building and evaluation.

Training the Model
The model is trained on a subset of the dataset. This process involves learning how different terms contribute to the probability of a review being positive or negative.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test set.

Results and Discussion
[Include a summary of the model's performance, insights obtained from the analysis, and any interesting trends observed in the data. Mention any challenges faced and how they were addressed.]

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of the Naive Bayes classifier in sentiment analysis, providing a foundational approach to understanding customer opinions in the restaurant industry. The methodology and findings can guide improvements in service quality and customer experience.

Future Work
Experimenting with different models and advanced NLP techniques.
Incorporating additional features like user ratings and temporal data.
Expanding the analysis to different domains or more nuanced sentiment classifications (e.g., neutral, mixed feelings).
